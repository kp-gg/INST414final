Final deliverable for semester project. An overview of my research on the relationship between employment status and telehealth services accessibility.
This research delves into how healthcare accessibility, specifically telehealth services, are potentially affected by employment status. The point of this
research was to demonstrate how predictive analysis models are effective tools to find correlations between factors that impact social justice issues.

## How to Run
1. Clone repo
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run notebooks or `make train`
